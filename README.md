Swift for animations
====================

## Introduce
Hi, I am Donny Ho,

This is my Swift projects for practising animation, inspired by [Allen Wang](https://twitter.com/creativewang) 30 days of Swift , I started to following on him, and made these projects. Plus other subject of Swift, I spend nearly six months from a totally beginner.  When you believe "Practice make perfect." things, then nothing would defeat you. Hoping people like me as a beginner will make courage to do these things seem impossible.
